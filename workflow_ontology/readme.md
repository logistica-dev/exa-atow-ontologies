# Exa-AToW Workflow Ontology

https://cnherrera.github.io/Exa-AToW_onto/workflow_ontology/index-en.html


The Exa-AToW Workflow Ontology (exaatow_workflow_ontology.ttl) provides a structured vocabulary to describe scientific workflows, their execution environments, provenance, and cross-WMS (Workflow Management System) interoperability. It extends and aligns with W3C standards including PROV-O, wfdesc, wfprov, and PAV to provide domain-specific capabilities for heterogeneous workflow systems.
