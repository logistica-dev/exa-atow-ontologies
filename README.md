# Exa-AToW Ontologies

The **[Exa-AToW](https://numpex.org/exaatow-architectures-and-tools-for-large-scale-workflows/)** (Architectures and Tools for Large-Scale Workflows) project, part of the [NumPEx](https://numpex.org/) PEPR, aims at providing solutions for the efficient management of large-scale workflows composed of HPDA, AI, and HPC tasks that are distributed over a continuum of resources ranging from the Exascale, HPC, and Data infrastructures. 

This repository houses the formal ontologies developed for the project, providing a structured, semantic representation of key concepts, relationships, and constraints within our system.

## 🔍 Structure

Our project encompasses several complex domains - key concepts for the Exa-AToW ecosystem, and we've designed a modular set of ontologies to capture the specific knowledge in each area:



1. [HPC](https://github.com/logistica-dev/exa-atow-ontologies/tree/main/workflow_ontology) (High-Performance Computing) Environment Ontology: Covers physical and virtual resources in HPC, including compute nodes, storage, interconnects, and infrastructure.

2. Job Submission Ontology: This component focuses on the semantics of submitting computational jobs to various execution environments. It covers concepts like job parameters, resource requirements (e.g., CPU, memory, time), submission protocols, and execution targets.

3. Processor Indicator Estimator: Groups estimation tools, metrics, and models used to assess processor indicators such as power consumption, thermal footprint, and die size.

4. Workflow Ontology:

        This ontology formally defines the concepts and relationships related to scientific and computational workflows. It models the structure, dependencies, execution logic, and state transitions of complex multi-step processes. Workflow Properties are  based on:  
  > Suter, F., et al. (2026). *A terminology for scientific workflow systems*. FGCS 174, 107974. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2025.107974)





- User: (TBD) Describes individuals or agents interacting with HPC systems, including identity attributes, roles, and behaviors.
- Authentication: (TBD) Models authentication concepts including credentials, identity validation, access protocols, and login activities.
- Digital Twins: (TBD)

## Repository Structure

### Main Files (Root Directory)

The repository contains three primary files at the root level:

- **`ontology_generator.py`**: Python script that generates the ontology file from JSON definitions. This script reads all JSON files in the `files/` folder and produces the complete ontology in Turtle format.

- **`ontology_config.yaml`**: Configuration file containing ontology metadata, namespaces, and generation settings. Modify this file to update ontology-level information (e.g., version, authors, namespaces).

- **`exaatow-ontology.ttl`**: Main ontology file in Turtle format. This file is **automatically generated** by `ontology_generator.py` based on the JSON files defined in the `files/` folder. **Do not edit this file manually** - instead, modify the JSON source files.


### files folder
This `files` folder in this repository contains JSON files that define the ontology structure, each file serving a specific purpose:

#### Class Definitions
- `main_classes.json` - Core top-level classes of the ontology

- `sub_HPC_classes.json` - Subclasses related to High-Performance Computing concepts
- `sub_PIE_classes.json` - Subclasses for PIE (Performance, Integration, Execution) components
- `sub_Job_classes.json` - Subclasses defining job-related entities
- `sub_Workflow_classes.json` - Subclasses for workflow structures and components
- `sub_PhysChar_classes.json` - Subclasses for physical characteristics
- ...

> **Note**: Each area of the project should have a JSON file with this structure. Each partner should fill in the required information for their domain.

#### Property Definitions
- `properties_HPC.json` - Object and data properties specific to HPC domain
- `properties_workflow.json` - Properties for workflow description and relationships
- ...
> **Note**: Each area of the project should have a JSON file with this structure. Each partner should fill in the required information for their domain.

#### Instance Data
- `instances_workflow.json` - Individual instances of workflow entities
- ....

#### Restrictions and Constraints
- `add_restrictions_hasValue_hasUnit.json` - Value restrictions and unit assignments for properties

# Updating the Ontology

![Ontology construction description](resources/ontology_collaboration_description.png)

When modifying the ontology, update the appropriate JSON file(s) based on what you're changing:

## Adding New Classes

Each project area should have its own JSON file using the same structure.

### Entry Example
The `parent_class` field can be omitted if the entry directly belongs (subClassOf) to the class designated in the name of the JSON file.
```json
{
    "id": "ComputeNode",
    "parent_class": "HPCResource",
    "pref_label": {"en": "Node", "fr": "Noeud"},
    "comment": {
       "en": "A physical or virtual server that executes computational jobs within a partition.",
       "fr": "Un serveur physique ou virtuel qui exécute des tâches de calcul au sein d'une partition."
    },
    "link_html": "https://wiki.external.link" 
    "equivalent": "https://link.to.ontology#Concept"
}

```

### Steps:
- Edit the relevant `main_classes.json` or `sub_*_classes.json` file
- Add your class definition following the structure above
- Validate the JSON syntax before committing

## Adding Properties

The goal is to define relationships between existing classes using JSON property definitions. For example, connect a `Processor` class to a `DieSize` class using a `hasDieSize` property.

### Property Example
The `parent_class` field can be omitted if the entry directly belongs (subClassOf) to the class designated in the name of the JSON file.
```json
{
    "id": "hasDieSize",
    "property_type": "ObjectProperty",    
    "domain": "Processor",
    "range": "DieSize",
    "pref_label": {
        "en": "has die size",
        "fr": "a taille de puce"
    },
    "comment": {
        "en": "Processor has a die size, including a numeric value and a unit (e.g., mm²).",
        "fr": "Processeur a une taille de puce, incluant une valeur numérique et une unité (ex : mm²)."  
    }
}
```
### Steps:
*Option 1* : Add to existing file
- Add your property to an existing properties_*.json file if it fits that domain

*Option 2* : Create new file
- Create a new file: `properties_<your_field>.json` (in files folder)
- Add your properties as an array
- Register the file in `list_properties` in the ontology_generator.py file (`main`)


## Adding Instances

Only fixed instances will be included in the ontology.
To create instances for your area, create a JSON file with each instance defined as follows (see `files/instances_workflow.json` for reference):

### Instance Example
```json

{
    "instance_name": "InMemory",
    "class_type": "DataManagementStorage",
    "pref_label": {"en": "In-Memory", "fr": "En mémoire"},
    "comment": {
        "en": "Data held in RAM.",
        "fr": "Données conservées en RAM."
    }
}
```
### Steps:
- Modify `instances_workflow.json` or create a new instances file
- Add your instance definitions following the structure above
- Validate the JSON syntax before committing


## Visualization
To visualize the ontology:

- Use WebVOWL (through the ontology webpage generated with Widoco: XXXX)
- Open the `exaatow-ontology.ttl` with the open-source software Protege.
- visualization tool in the Python file. After loading the ontology:
```
onto.visualize_graph(
    output_file="my_ontology_visualization.html",
    height="600px",
    physics=False  # Disable physics for static layout
```
and open the html file with a browser.
