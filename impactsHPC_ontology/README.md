# Impacts-HPC Ontology

Impacts-HPC is a Python library designed to estimate the environmental impacts of jobs on data centers.

This ontology defines the conceptual framework underlying the Impacts-HPC library. It covers both the physical elements of HPC centers and the ecological aspects associated with their operation. The ontology aims to promote data reuse and interoperability within and beyond the Exa-AtoW project.
